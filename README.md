# Simple Voting System (Java Console App)

⚠️ This is a terminal-based Java application. It does not use any graphical user interface (GUI).

This is a beginner-level Java project that simulates a simple voting system.  
It currently includes user registration and login functionality, with plans to expand into candidate voting and vote tracking.

## 📌 Features (so far)
- User registration (ID, name, age)
- Age validation (must be 18+ to register)
- Duplicate ID validation
- Login using ID
- User data stored and loaded from a file

## 🛠 Technologies Used
- Java (basic syntax, methods, classes)
- File Handling (read/write using `FileWriter`, `Scanner`)
- ArrayList for storing user data temporarily
- Console input via `Scanner`

## 📁 Structure
- `Main.java`: Entry point of the program
- `UserHandling.java`: Manages user registration and login
- `FileHandling.java`: Handles reading/writing user data to a file
- `UserFormat.java`: Data model for users
- `Menu.java`: Simple text-based menu
- `HomePage.java`: (To be implemented) Will handle voting functionality

## 🚀 Planned Features
- Voting menu after login
- Candidate list and vote casting
- Vote tallying and result display
- Basic login security (optional)
